- This is the most common dynamic route where the segment inside square brackets represents a dynamic value in the URL.

- **Example**: `/dynamic-segments/[slug]` matches `/dynamic-segments/hello-world`, `/dynamic-segments/another-post`, etc.

- Folder Structure:
  ```
  app
  └──dynamic-segments
      └── [slug]
          └── page.tsx
  ```
